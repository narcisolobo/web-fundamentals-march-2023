# Presentation Process

## General Guidelines
- Keep your presentation length down to about three to five minutes
- I wouldn't be mad if you dressed up a little
- Treat it as practice for interviews

## Presentation Content
1. Pull up the landing page
2. Tell us your name and project title
3. Tell us why you built this project
4. What tech stacks did you use and why
5. What extra tech did you use and why
6. Demo the project - give us a short tour of each page/feature
7. Take a couple of questions
